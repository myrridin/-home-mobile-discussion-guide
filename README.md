# @home Mobile Discussion Guide
This is a mobile web version of the discussion guide for @home, a documentary film examining homelessness in contemporary America.

This project is based on Ratchet, a mobile-exclusive web framework: http://goratchet.com/

The current prototype files are in /static. These pages are only usable on a mobile device or a desktop browser with mobile device emulation (such as Chrome).
